texasholdem-engine
============

The engine for the Texas Hold 'em competition at TheAIGames.com

This version of our Texas Hold 'em engine has been set up for local use, for your own convenience. Note that this does *not* include the visualizer. Also note that this engine is largely the same as our Omaha engine, but this is the actual version we use on the website.

To compile (Linux):

    cd [project folder]
    ./compile.sh
    
To run:

    cd [project folder]
    ./run.sh

To zip for submission:
    
    cd [project folder]
    ./zip.sh


This fork is editted so that game messages are printed to standard out and the bot plays against itself using `run.sh`.
